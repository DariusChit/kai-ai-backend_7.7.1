Create a grading policy for primary school students (grades 1-6). The policy should reflect a balance between academic achievement and developmental progress. Include the following elements:
Assessment Components: Detail how students will be assessed through assignments, quizzes, projects, and participation. Example weightage: 30% assignments, 25% quizzes, 25% projects, 20% participation.
Grade Scale: Use a clear scale with descriptive terms:
  1. Outstanding (O)
  2. Proficient (P)
  3. Basic (B)
  4. Needs Improvement (N)
Performance Expectations: Emphasize understanding of key concepts, effort, and improvement.
Feedback and Improvement: Provide constructive feedback and describe how students can improve through extra help or revising assignments.
Communication: Explain how progress will be communicated to students and parents, including report cards and informal updates.
Special Considerations: Outline accommodations and support available for students with learning differences.
